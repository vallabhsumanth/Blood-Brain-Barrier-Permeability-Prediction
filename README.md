# Light-Gradient-Boosting
Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability Prediction Model with LightGBM, XGBoost, and Cross-Validation.
This project investigates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of compounds. The BBB is a semipermeable membrane that restricts the passage of substances from the bloodstream to the brain. Understanding BBB permeability is crucial for drug discovery, as it helps identify drugs that can effectively reach their target sites within the brain.

# Methodology
This project employs two powerful machine learning algorithms: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Both algorithms are known for their efficiency and accuracy in handling complex classification tasks.

The project utilizes a technique called cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the models. Cross-validation involves splitting the available data into two sets: a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the models, while the testing set is used to assess their generalizability to unseen data. This process helps prevent overfitting, where the models simply memorize the training data and perform poorly on new data.
